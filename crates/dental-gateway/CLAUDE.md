# Open-API rules
1. For every new or modified endpoint, modify the open-api documentation via Utopia in code
2. Anything that is a Query Param should be put in utopia-utils as reusable query param with relevant documentation
3. If there is a way to convert the grpc responses to open-api responses, do it
