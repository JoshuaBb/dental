## Changes made:

3. Converted gRPC passthrough responses to typed OpenAPI response structs (HealthApiResponse, ReadyApiResponse, StatusApiResponse)
4. Annotated all three route handlers with `#[utoipa::path]` macros
5. Added `#[derive(OpenApi)] ApiDoc` struct in main.rs referencing all paths and schemas
