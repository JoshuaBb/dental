# Input
In dental-gateway I cannot open swagger

# Root Cause
The hand-rolled swagger HTML in `main.rs` referenced `SwaggerUIBundle.SwaggerUIStandalonePreset`
which does not exist on the bundle object (it would be `undefined` at runtime), causing the
Swagger UI to fail to initialize.

# Fix
- Upgraded `utoipa` from v4 → v5 in `dental-gateway/Cargo.toml` and `dental-common/Cargo.toml`
- Added `utoipa-swagger-ui = { version = "9", features = ["axum"] }` to `dental-gateway/Cargo.toml`
- Replaced the hand-rolled HTML handler with `SwaggerUi::new("/swagger-ui").url("/api-docs/openapi.json", ApiDoc::openapi())`
- Removed the now-unused `swagger_ui()` async fn and its route registration

# Branch
open-api-gateway-ai-2
