# Input
Revert routes.js to add the utopia information

# Root Cause
`routes.rs` was missing the utoipa response schema structs (`HealthApiResponse`, `ReadyApiResponse`,
`StatusApiResponse`) and `#[utoipa::path]` annotations that `main.rs` already referenced in its
`#[derive(OpenApi)]` block. Handler functions were also private (`async fn`) instead of `pub async fn`.

Additionally, `HealthRequest` and `ReadyRequest` were being constructed without their required
`context` field (added to the proto after `routes.rs` was last edited).

# Fix
- Added `HealthApiResponse`, `ReadyApiResponse`, `StatusApiResponse` structs with `#[derive(Serialize, ToSchema)]`
- Added `#[utoipa::path]` annotations to `health`, `ready`, and `status` handler functions
- Made `health`, `ready`, and `status` handler functions `pub`
- Changed `status` to return `Json<StatusApiResponse>` (typed) instead of `Json<Value>`
- Fixed pre-existing compile error: `HealthRequest {}` → `HealthRequest { context: None }` (x2)
- Fixed pre-existing compile error: `ReadyRequest {}` → `ReadyRequest { context: None }` (x2)
