As a dentist, you'd typically input the following into dental practice management software:

- TMJ assessments and occlusal analysis
- Oral pathology findings and biopsy notes

**Treatment Planning**
- Multi-phase treatment plans with sequencing

- Fee estimates and insurance pre-authorizations

**Restorative & Prosthetic Documentation**
- Procedures performed (fillings, crowns, bridges, dentures, implants)
- Materials used (composite, amalgam, ceramic type)

**Radiographic Interpretation**

The core difference from a hygienist role is that dentist inputs center on **diagnosis, definitive treatment, prescribing, and treatment planning**, whereas the hygienist focuses on preventive care and periodontal charting.
